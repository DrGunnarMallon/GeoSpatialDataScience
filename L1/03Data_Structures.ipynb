    "## Introduction to Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have learned about variables, you are well on your way to being able to write a complete program in Python. Most of the time, when programming, you don't just want individual variables, but you want to group these together. Think of personal details, you could have individual variables `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email_address`. But it makes sense to group these together. That's where data structures come in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures are fundamental constructs used to organize, store, and manage data efficiently. They provide a way to represent, access, and manipulate data in a structured and organized manner within a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Data Structures Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures are essential in computer science and programming for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficient Data Storage:** Data structures enable efficient storage of data, reducing memory usage and optimizing storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quick Data Retrieval:** Properly chosen data structures facilitate quick and efficient data retrieval, reducing the time complexity of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Organization:** They help in organizing data logically, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Algorithm Design:** Many algorithms and operations depend on the choice of data structure. Choosing the right one can significantly impact the efficiency of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Real-World Analogies:** Data structures often mimic real-world analogies, making it easier to understand and work with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of data structures, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Some common data structures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Lists:](#lists)** Lists are ordered collections of elements where elements can be of different data types and can be dynamically resized. You use lists to store and manage a collection of items of varying types, such as a list of names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Tuples:](#tuples)** Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of elements. They are used for storing a fixed set of related data elements, representing coordinates, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Sets:](#sets)** Sets are collections of unique elements with no specific order. Use sets for storing and managing unique elements, implementing mathematical sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Dictionaries:](dictionaries)** Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a value. Dictionaries (or dict for short) are used to store data with associated metadata, such as storing user information by their username.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at each of the four main data structures in more detail below. Other data structures include ones like **stacks and queues**, **linked lists**, and **trees**. However, we will not cover these in the course as that would be beyond its scope.hat would be beyond its scope. that would be beyond its scope.ture and explore their applications and implementations.\n"

    "##  Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures in Python. They are ordered collections that can store elements of different data types. In this section, we'll dive deep into lists, covering their creation, manipulation, and various operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an ordered collection of elements, where each element is identified by an index. Lists are versatile and can store elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and more. To create a list in Python, you enclose a sequence of elements within square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a list of integers\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a list of strings\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing List Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access individual elements in a list using indexing. Python uses 0-based indexing, where the first element has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing elements by index\n",
    "first_element = my_list[0]  # Accesses the first element (1)\n",
    "second_element = my_list[1]  # Accesses the second element (2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use negative indexing to access elements from the end of the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing elements using negative indexing\n",
    "last_element = my_list[-1]  # Accesses the last element (5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable, which means you can change their contents after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Modifying list elements\n",
    "my_list[2] = 99  # Changes the third element to 99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can concatenate two or more lists using the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "result = list1 + list2  # Concatenates the lists\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "You can replicate a list by using the * operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "original_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "repeated_list = original_list * 3  # Repeats the list three times\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "subset = my_list[1:4]  # Retrieves elements from index 1 to 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several built-in methods to manipulate lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "**append()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The append() method adds an element to the end of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\n",
    "fruits.append(\"cherry\")  # Adds \"cherry\" to the end of the list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**insert()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The insert() method inserts an element at a specified position in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits.insert(1, \"banana\")  # Inserts \"banana\" at index 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**remove()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The remove() method removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits.remove(\"banana\")  # Removes \"banana\" from the list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**pop()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pop() method removes and returns an element from a specified index or the last element if no index is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "removed_fruit = fruits.pop(1)  # Removes and returns \"banana\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**index()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The index() method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "index = fruits.index(\"cherry\")  # Returns the index of \"cherry\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**count()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The count() method returns the number of times a specified element appears in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n",
    "count = numbers.count(2)  # Returns 3 (number of times 2 appears)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**sort()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sort() method arranges the elements of a list in ascending order (for numbers and strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [3, 1, 2, 4]\n",
    "numbers.sort()  # Sorts the list in ascending order\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**reverse()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse() method reverses the order of elements in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits.reverse()  # Reverses the order of elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nested Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested list is a list that contains other lists as its elements. This allows you to create multi-dimensional data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access elements of a nested list using multiple indices.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are another essential data structure in Python. They are similar to lists but with a key difference: tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. In this section, we'll explore tuples in depth, covering their creation, properties, and common use cases. A tuple is an ordered collection of elements, just like a list. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, which means once you create a tuple, you cannot modify its elements. Tuples are typically used for data that should not be changed during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple in Python, you enclose a sequence of elements within parentheses `()`, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple of integers\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tuple of strings\n",
    "names = (\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Tuple Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access individual elements in a tuple using indexing, similar to lists. Python uses 0-based indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing elements by index\n",
    "first_element = my_tuple[0]  # Accesses the first element (1)\n",
    "second_element = my_tuple[1]  # Accesses the second element (2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use negative indexing to access elements from the end of the tuple, just like with lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing elements using negative indexing\n",
    "last_element = my_tuple[-1]  # Accesses the last element (5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Packing and Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple packing is the process of creating a tuple by placing multiple values (elements) inside parentheses. Tuple unpacking is the process of assigning values from a tuple to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tuple packing\n",
    "coordinates = (3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple unpacking\n",
    "x, y = coordinates  # x is 3, y is 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have a few built-in methods, but they are limited due to their immutability:\n",
    "\n",
    "**count()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The count() method returns the number of times a specified element appears in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4)\n",
    "count = numbers.count(2)  # Returns 3 (number of times 2 appears)\n",

    "**index()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The index() method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
    "\n",

    "index = fruits.index(\"cherry\")  # Returns the index of \"cherry\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutability of Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key characteristics of tuples is their immutability. Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements. Attempting to modify a tuple will result in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases for Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are commonly used in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Returning Multiple Values from Functions: You can use tuples to return multiple values from a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_name_and_age():\n",
    "    return (\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Integrity: When you want to ensure that the data remains unchanged.\n",
    "* Dictionary Keys: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable (unlike lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you've delved into the world of tuples in Python. You've learned what tuples are, how to create and access them, and their immutability. Tuples are valuable when you need to ensure that certain data remains unchanged throughout your program.\n",

    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are versatile data structures in Python that allow you to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs. In this section, we'll explore dictionaries in depth, covering their creation, operations, and common use cases. A dictionary is an unordered collection of data in a key-value pair format. Each key in a dictionary is unique, and it is associated with a value. Dictionaries are often used when you need to organize data based on labels or identifiers (keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dictionary in Python, you enclose key-value pairs within curly braces `{}`. Each key is separated from its corresponding value by a colon `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a dictionary of contact information\n",
    "contact_info = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "    \"email\": \"alice@example.com\",\n",
    "    \"phone\": \"555-1234\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an empty dictionary\n",
    "empty_dict = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Dictionary Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access values in a dictionary by using the associated keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing values by key\n",
    "name = contact_info[\"name\"]  # Accesses the value associated with the \"name\" key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are mutable, which means you can change their values by assigning new values to specific keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Modifying values in a dictionary\n",
    "contact_info[\"phone\"] = \"555-5678\"  # Updates the phone number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several built-in methods for working with dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "**get()**\n",
    "The get() method retrieves the value associated with a key, or a default value if the key does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using get() to retrieve a value\n",
    "email = contact_info.get(\"email\", \"N/A\")  # Retrieves the email or \"N/A\" if not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**keys()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys() method returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Getting all keys in a dictionary\n",
    "keys_list = contact_info.keys()  # Returns a list of keys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**values()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The values() method returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Getting all values in a dictionary\n",
    "values_list = contact_info.values()  # Returns a list of values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**items()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The items() method returns a list of key-value pairs (tuples) as a view object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Getting all key-value pairs in a dictionary\n",
    "items_list = contact_info.items()  # Returns a view object of key-value pairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases for Dictionaries\n",

    "Dictionaries are commonly used in various scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Storage: Storing and retrieving data based on unique identifiers or keys.\n",
    "* Configuration Settings: Storing configuration settings for applications.\n",
    "* Counting and Frequency: Counting occurrences of items or calculating frequencies.\n",
